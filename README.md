### Implemented Functions
printList: It is a function to print out the content of a list. It takes in a list and its size
as arguments. It does not return any value.

inSort: It performs Insertion Sort in ascending order on a list. It takes in a list and
its size as arguments. It returns the sorted list as a new list. You may use sorted_list
defined in the data segment in this function.

bSearch : It performs a recursive Binary Search of a key on a list. It takes in a
list, its size, and a search key as arguments. It returns 1 if the key exists in
the list, otherwise it returns 0. You must implement this algorithm recursively;
therefore, be aware of the use of stack memory.
